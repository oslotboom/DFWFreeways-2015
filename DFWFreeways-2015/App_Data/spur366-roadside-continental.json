On May 25, 2016, the bridge was named the Ronald Kirk Pedestrian Bridge, in honor of the former Dallas mayor who was in office from 1995 to 2002. Kirk also served in the Obama administration as U.S. Trade Representative. On June 15, 2016, the plaza at the west end of the bridge was named for World War II Navy veteran Felix Lozada. ",
