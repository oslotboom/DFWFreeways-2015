The interchange footprint was expanded in a project in the early 2000s, and the tollway main lanes over Texas 121 opened in 2004. A five-level interchange was completed in November 2011. This location became a favored area for corporate relocations in the 2010s, with Toyota USA, Fedex Office and Liberty Mutual insurance all building major offices as of 2015.",
