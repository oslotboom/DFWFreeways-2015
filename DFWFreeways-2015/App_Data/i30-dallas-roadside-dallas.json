The original interchange opened in 1970 was the first modern-design four-level interchange in North Texas, and was the first of six interchanges which used the distintive \"double T\" central pylon. The I-30 archive photos include a viewe of the original interchange. <br /><br /> As of September 2022, these photos remain accurate, except for the view at Bass Pro road, where the interchange for the Bush Turnpike was built.",
