This interchange was called the Diamond Interchange for a period of time around 2010, but that name has been retired. With completion of the Irving Interchange, all freeway construction work at the site of the former Texas Stadium is complete.<br/><br/>When these photos were taken on May 19, 2024, final work including painting and landscaping was still in progress.",
