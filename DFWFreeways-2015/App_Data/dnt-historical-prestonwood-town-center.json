  "text": "Prestonwood Town Center was located on the northeast side of the intersection of the Dallas North Tollway and Belt Line Road. The mall opened in August 1979 with anchor stores Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor, J.C. Penney and Montgomery Ward. It featured the latest in mall amenities, including an ice-skating rink, glass vaulted roof and huge center court. In April 1996 plans were announced for a $125 million renovation, but the project did not move forward. In September 1997 JCPenney announced it would close its store, and Mervyns closed. In October 1997 Nieman Marcus announced it will move the store to Plano, but the store would remain open until the replacement store opened 2001. In 1999 the mall was closed, but Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor remained open. In August 2001 the Shops at Willowbend opened along the Dallas North Tollway in Plano, including Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor. In May 2004 final demolition of the mall and remaining anchor stores was in progress. Construction soon began to build conventional strip shopping centers on the site. A Walmart would be built on the site soon afterward.",
