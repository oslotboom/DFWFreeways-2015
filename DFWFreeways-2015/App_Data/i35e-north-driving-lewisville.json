The expansion project created two reversible HOT lanes, added collector-distributor lanes between Bush Turnpike and SH 121, and added two general purpose lanes north of SH 121. In July 2021 a $655 million contract was awarded for the second (and final) phase of work between IH-635 and Bush Turnpike.",
