The $301 million Irving Interchange project, from 2021 to 2023, completed SH 114 to its final configuration at the Texas Stadium site.<br/><br/>SH 114 was originally planned to have eight main lanes and four managed lanes through Irving, and the wide freeway west of Loop 12 was built to that standard in 2012. However, further work was suspended due to lack of funding and other regional priorities. <br/><br />As of 2022, any further expansion of SH 114 is not scheduled and not funded. The long-term NCTCOG transportation plan shows six main lanes with two managed lanes east of SH 348 (Northwest Highway), and eight main lanes with two managed lanes west of SH 348.",

      "caption": "The freeway in Irving is named for John W. Carpenter (1881-1959). Carpenter was a successful executive and businessman, serving as president and chairman of the board of Texas Power and Light. In 1930 he founded Southland Life Insurance Company. Around 1928, Carpenter began acquiring land in the area of present-day Las Colinas, with the ranch growing to approximately 6000 acres. Carpenter donated the right-of-way for SH 114 and SH 183 where those freeways passed through his property. His son Ben Carpenter developed the ranch into Las Colinas starting in the 1970s. ",
