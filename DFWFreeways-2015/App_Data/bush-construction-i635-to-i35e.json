  "text": "This section of the Bush Turnpike, between I-635 and I-35E, was called the \"super connector\" when it was planned and built because it filled a missing link between SH 161 to the south and SH 190 to the east. This section of the tollway opened on September 9, 2005. These views start at IH 635 and proceed northward.",
