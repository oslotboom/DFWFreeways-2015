  "text": "The pedestrian bridges opened on June 10, 2021, after a four year delay. The pedestian bridges were completed in 2017 but did not open because engineers realized the steel rods were vibrating in high winds, which led to cracking of cables, causing one to come loose. Certain testing was omitted prior to construction, and it turned out that there were technical issues with the design, requiring $7 million in repairs and the long delay.",
