  "text": "Valley Mall, opened in 1973 at the northwest corner of LBJ Freeway and Preston Road, was in steep decline in the 2000s. Plans for demolition and redevelopment of the property were first announced in 2012, but efforts were on hold for years with limited demolition taking place. Demolition of the three remaining anchor stores was underway in 2019.<br /> <br/>On August 8, 2022, the Dallas Morning News reported that the owner of the former Sears property, Seritage Growth Properties, had canceled plans for development and had begun efforts to sell the 22.5 acres. Most of the mall site including the remaining structure is owned by Beck Ventures. On December 6, 2022, the Dallas Morning News reported that the Dallas City Attorney had issued a deadline of July 28, 2023, to complete demolition of the remaining structure - the center of the mall and the former cinema. <br /> <br/>In March 2023 a fire occured in the remaining structure, prompting officials to accelerate demolition. However, as of mid-April 2023, a substantial amount of the structure still remained.",
