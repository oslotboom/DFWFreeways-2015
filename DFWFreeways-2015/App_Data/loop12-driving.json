The bridge was built with a 52-foot clearance over the average river level in anticipation of the construction of the Trinity waterway navigable barge canal. The construction contract for the Loop 12 bridge was awarded in January 1973, and on March 13, 1973, voters rejected a $150 million bond issue which would have covered the local share of the cost of the barge canal. The Trinity waterway navigation canal project was on life support after the election, and dead by the late 1970s. So, the extra clearance and long span of the bridge turned out to be a waste of money.",
