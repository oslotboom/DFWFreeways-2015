These photos show the freeway before the Southern Gateway project.<br/><br/>From I-35E to I-20, the freeway originally had four main lanes and two HOV lanes, one in each direction. The Southern Gateway project modified this section to have six main lanes and one reversible express lane.<br /><br /> From Interstate 20 southward to Belt Line Road, a third main lane in each direction was added.",
