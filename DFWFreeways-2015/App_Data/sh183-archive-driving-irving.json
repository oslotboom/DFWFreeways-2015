    "text": "Reconstruction and expansion of the SH 183 took place from 2015 to 2018, from east of Regal Row in Dallas to Belt Line in Irving. Photos of this section show the original, narrow six-lane freeway which lacked interior shoulders.<br /><br />West of Belt Line to SH 360, barrier-separated managed lanes (one in each direction) were added by converting the interior shoulder and narrowing the main lanes. The overall configuration (i.e. width and structures) of the freeway remained the same. This photo collection shows the freeway before the addition of the managed lanes.",
