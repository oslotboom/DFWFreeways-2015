Although this photo was captioned by the Dallas Library  as \"removing trackage along the route of central expressway\", a DFWFreeways.com reader pointed out that the photo clearly indicates the installation of new track, as evidenced by the new railroad ties, lack of discarded spikes, and lack of alignment of the ties (an existing track's ties would be aligned). So this is almost certainly the new alignment of track built to the east of the freeway from Mockingbird northward to around Lovers Lane. The new alignment allowed the right-of-way of the old alignment to be used for the freeway. The freeway at this location opened on April 15, 1953. The opening was delayed about a year due to a shortage of steel for the railroad bridge over Central Expressway. (Source: Dallas Public Library) "
