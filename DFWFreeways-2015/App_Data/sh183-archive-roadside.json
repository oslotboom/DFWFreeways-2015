    "text": "There has been a tremendous amount of change along SH 183 in Irving since I first collected photos for this section of freeway in the 2000s. In April 2010 Texas Stadium was demolished, and the site was used as a construction staging area in the 2010s. In 2018 major expansion was completed in Irving from Belt Line Road to Regal Road in Dallas. The Irving Interchange project, 2021-2023, finished the freeway to its ultimate design at the Texas Stadium site.",
