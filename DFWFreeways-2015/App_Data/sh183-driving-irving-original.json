The first phase expanded the corridor to its ultimate width, rebuilt the frontage roads, partially rebuilt the main lanes and added managed lanes. The photos east of Belt Line are now totally obsolete and serve as a historical archive of the original freeway. Photos west of Belt Line show the original freeway, which has been modified to have barrier-separated managed lanes.",
