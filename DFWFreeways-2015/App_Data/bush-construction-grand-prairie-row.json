However, the area shown in these photos was not the neighborhood which filed the lawsuit against the project. The neighborhood filing the lawsuit was on the northwest side of the I-30/Bush Turnpike interchange. The 1983 lawsuit resulted in a 1985 court injunction which prevented further work. The injunction was lifted in 1998, and an appeals court ended legal action in 2000 by ruling in favor of the freeway."
