"text": "This view shows work on phase 1 of the expansion at Belt Line Road, which was completed in 2017. The frontage roads were raised above the railroad tracks, and the IH-35 main lanes are elevated above the frontage roads. In July 2021 a $655 million contract was awarded for the second (and final) phase of the IH-35 expansion between IH-635 and the Bush Turnpike. The freeway will be widened to 8 main lanes (four each way) and at least one managed lane in each direction. At Belt Line, the structure will be widened to accoommodate additional lanes.",
