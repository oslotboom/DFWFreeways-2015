                                This illustration is on the first page of the main text of the book, paying tribute to the crazy stunts and huge celebrations which have been held for North Texas freeways.
                                This scene takes place in 1972, just after the founding of Southwest Airlines in 1971. The Southwest flight attendants are wearing the classic orange mini-skirt uniforms with the white go-go boots.
                                And they were all hotties back then - no dudes allowed! The crowd has some typical North Texas personas from the early 1970s, including fashion girls, a hippy, a redneck and a black power dude.
                                You may have seen the "Luv" heart on actual Southwest aircraft. This one says "North Texans Luv Freeways".

                                This illustration pays tribute to the tremendous effort which was required to build the Dallas outer loop, the Bush Turnpike (with frontage roads signed SH 190 and SH 161).
                                Due to the controversy and lawsuits engulfing the project in the 1970s and 1980s, it seemed like a mission impossible to get the freeway built. The illustration scene is room like a Hall of Justice
                                where our superheroes are receiving instructions from the old scientist, a guy modeled after the character "Q" in James Bond films. ("Q" would present high-tech gadgets to Bond.)

                                The first superhero on the left is Legalonic Woman, inspired by Wonder Woman. She represents the power needed to achieve victory in the lawsuits against the project.
                                The middle superhero is Captain Toll, inspired by Captain America. He represents the role of tolls in making it financially possible to build the turnpike.
                                The right superhero is Super TxDOT-man, inspired by Superman. He pays tribute to TxDOT's perseverence in planning and developing the project, keeping it alive through the freeway dark age of the 1970s.

                                In February 1966 anticipation was building for the opening of the final section of Thornton Freeway, the downtown "Canyon". With its concentration of entrances and exits, the Canyon would introduce
                                previously-unseen complexity to the Dallas Freeway system, and the Dallas Chamber of Commerce launched an information campaign to educate motorists on how to navigate the downtown interchange complex.
                                The illustration above is an adaptation of a graphic which appeared in the February 1966 <em>Dallas Times-Herald</em>, showing two motorists about to enter the "Thornton Maze". The image was illustrated
                                in the Philippines.

                                The original graphic (and this new version) include an obscure historical reference to 54-40-or fight. The reference is to the campaign slogan
                                of 1844 presidental candidate James Polk, who advocated taking control
                                of the entire Oregon Territory, even if it meant war with Great Britain. The Oregon Territory then extended to latitude 54°40' to include about half
                                of present-day British Columbia. Polk won the election, and the boundary was set to present-day 49° in the 1946 Treaty of Oregon.

                                I designed and illustrated the sign all by myself! I had to bring in my illustrator to complete the drawing. Yes, the guy next to the Corvette wearing the black jacket does look like the Fonz.

                                Six nearly-identical interchanges where opened on Interstates 635 and 20 between 1970 and 1974. Chapter 8 includes a section on these interchanges, which I call the cookie-cutter interchanges.
                                The kids are thrilled to see their cookies (well, in this case the interchanges) come out of the oven. The six photos on the cookie sheet show the six interchanges. Unfortunately it is not possible
                                to photograph all six interchanges from the same angle with good lighting conditions, so they don't look exactly the same. (I agonized over whether I should have instead used the same image six times.)
                                The kitchen decor is early-1970s style. In fact, the oven looks very similar to the oven in the house I grew up in, which was built in 1969.

                                The neighborhood's lawsuit against the freeway was filed in 1983 and legal proceedings did not end until 2000, when the freeway was finally cleared for construction.

                                it is painfully narrow. Unfortunately I commuted on the DNT from Addison to Frisco for four years.
